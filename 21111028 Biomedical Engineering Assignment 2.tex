With time, the infusion of modern technology with health care has proved to be very efficient not just in diagnosing the patient, but also helping with the treatment and in keeping proper track and better records of the patient. The first aid response time has also been significantly reduced. Although the given evolution in the health care system, it certainly cannot be denied that with time viruses and other life invading microbes have also been evolving.

Health is not a national concern. It is a global concern. Any invention in health care would be basically of no use if it isn't accessible to the patient. Since the beginning of the 21st century, many initiatives have been taken by international and national levels in order to strengthen national health systems so as to strengthen the core of the global health system.

The technological breakthroughs including the innovations in semi-conductors, the increase in the computational power of the devices and also the lowering of cost of the computational power have been some of the main factors for the onset of much needed personalized medicine. It is not just biology alone but the combination of biology and engineering that has brought about this evolution in the modern health care system.
\linebreak
\linebreak
The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in health care seems to be very promising. For instance, there is an ambient AI that could automate the process of clinical documentation for the doctor so that he's able to focus more on the patient rather than being indulged in the paperwork and other formalities. Speech - to - text technology of AI could certainly contribute to proper and efficient management of patient records while saving time, energy and also countering the storage issue effectively.
\linebreak
\linebreak
Accessibility to diagnosis and treatment was further improved by the innovation in making the medical devices portable and user friendly. Blockchain has been playing an integral part in keeping patient's data private and secure. The accuracy of the medical devices has also been improved.
\linebreak
\linebreak
Despite of the breakthroughs achieved and the innovations, not all modern devices are available locally in every part of the world. Although being effective, affording modern health care could prove to be economically very challenging for the common man. The rate of current population growth also adds fuel to fire as the modern health care facilities are already limited.
\linebreak
\linebreak
So, it can be concluded that the combination of technology and health care has certainly been a boon addressing speed, storage and ergonomic issues of the devices. As good as that may sound, due to the lack of accessibility and skyrocketing prices, not all can benefit from the modern health care yet. So, maybe our efforts shouldn't just be on inventing something new but should also be channelized on how it can be made affordable and available to the common man.
